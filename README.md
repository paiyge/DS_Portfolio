# Deep Learning - CS 7150 - Northeastern Univeristy 

This repo includes homeworks and projects completed during Dr. Tala Talaei Khoei's spring 24' CS 7150 Deep Learning course at Northeastern University. 

- Assignment 1: Breast Cancer SNN - Binary Shallow Neural Network to detect and diagnose the patients with breast cancers
- Assignment 2: Fruit Classification CNN - Categorical Convoluted Neural Network to identify different fruit varieties
- Assignment 3: Future Stock Market Prices RNN and LSTM - Predicitve Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory model to predict furture prices of stocks
- Assignment 4: TBD
- Final Project: TBC - Predciting Artists of Fine Art Paintings
- Final Project Report: TBC - final report following IEEE standards

Due to issue with dead kernels in jupyter notebook, all work was completed in Colab. 

#### Course Description
Introduction to deep learning, including the statistical learning framework, empirical risk minimization,
loss function selection, fully connected layers, convolutional layers, pooling layers, batch normalization,
multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, U-nets, residual networks, gradient
descent, stochastic gradient descent, backpropagation, autograd, visualization of neural network features,
robustness and adversarial examples, interpretability, continual learning, and applications in computer
vision and natural language processing. Assumes students already have a basic knowledge of machine
learning, optimization, linear algebra, and statistics.
